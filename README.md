# AWM Config

**AWM Config** is my own configuration repository for [AwesomeWM 4](https://awesomewm.org/).

## Getting Started

Just clone it in your awesome configuration dir (usually ~/.config/awesome/)  
Don't forget to clone the submodules (some standalone modules I have in other
repo) too:
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Kuroneer/awm_config.git
```
This configuration uses [Lain](https://github.com/lcpz/lain) to display the
filesystem widget. The dependency is optional and it won't break if it's not
found.
